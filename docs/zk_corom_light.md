# ZK-COROM Light System

## Overview

The ZK-COROM Light system provides zero-knowledge cryptographic integrity verification for physics simulations. This lightweight implementation allows for military-grade security without revealing sensitive simulation data or parameters.

## Core Concepts

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Mathematical methods to prove a statement is true without revealing the underlying information
- **Circuit-Based Verification**: Representing physics constraints as cryptographic circuits
- **Succinct Proofs**: Compact evidence of simulation correctness
- **Non-Interactive Verification**: Proofs can be verified without interaction with the prover

## System Components

- **Proof Generator**: Creates cryptographic proofs of simulation correctness
- **Verification Circuit**: Defines the rules that must be satisfied
- **Challenge Handler**: Processes external verification requests
- **Proof Verifier**: Validates proofs without access to original data

## Basic Usage

```cpp
// Initialize the system
ZKCOROMLight zk_system;
zk_system.initialize();

// Create a proof for current simulation state
auto proof = zk_system.generateProof(physics_solver);

// Verify a proof
bool is_valid = zk_system.verifyProof(proof);
```

## Supported Verification Properties

- Conservation of momentum
- Conservation of energy
- Proper integration of equations of motion
- Collision response correctness
- Boundary condition enforcement

## Performance Considerations

The ZK-COROM Light system balances security with performance:

- Proofs are generated only at configurable intervals
- Verification circuits use optimized algorithms
- Cryptographic operations can be hardware-accelerated
- Proof size is minimized for efficient storage and transmission
