# Contributing Guidelines

## Overview

While the Zero Point Physics Engine is released under a proprietary license, we welcome contributions that improve the codebase, fix bugs, or enhance functionality. This document outlines the process for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

- Respect the proprietary nature of the codebase
- Maintain confidentiality of military-grade features
- Engage constructively with other contributors
- Follow coding standards and best practices

## Getting Started

1. Read the documentation thoroughly
2. Understand the license restrictions
3. Set up your development environment
4. Familiarize yourself with the architecture

## Contribution Process

1. **Request access**: Contact the maintainers to request contributor access
2. **Create a branch**: Create a feature branch from the main branch
3. **Make changes**: Implement your changes following the coding standards
4. **Write tests**: Add tests to verify your changes
5. **Document**: Update relevant documentation
6. **Submit review**: Create a pull request with detailed description
7. **Respond to feedback**: Address review comments

## Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Follow C++17 standards and best practices
- Use consistent naming conventions:
  - `CamelCase` for classes and types
  - `snake_case` for functions and variables
  - `UPPER_CASE` for constants
  - Private member variables with trailing underscore: `member_`

### Documentation

- Document all public APIs with clear descriptions
- Use Doxygen-style comments for functions and classes
- Include usage examples for complex functionality

### Testing

- Add unit tests for new functionality
- Ensure tests cover normal and edge cases
- Verify performance impact for optimization changes

## Pull Request Requirements

- Clean, concise commits with meaningful messages
- Comprehensive tests that pass the CI pipeline
- Updated documentation reflecting your changes
- No degradation in performance or verification quality
- Compliance with coding standards

## Licensing

By contributing to the project, you agree that your contributions will be subject to the project's proprietary license. All submissions must be your original work and free from third-party licenses incompatible with our licensing terms.
